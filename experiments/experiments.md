Here you can see the both the finalised experiment as well as the code completed on the microbit website.

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was building on the breadbaord, as I have no expeirence with this in the past I found it both challenging as well as fulfilling when getting something working. The build itself was nothing too hard, I simply had to connect the LED strip to the microbit via the 3volt connection and connect the pressure sensor to the ground. While I was building the breadboard, Keenan was writing up the code using the microbit website. Doing this he dictated that when downloaded the microbit would be stuck on a forever loop with the neopixel flashing the LED lights. A secondary piece of code was made up for the pressure sensor that would make the sensor operate as a method of changing the LED's colour. When pushed forward or back the colour of the LED strip would change. This experiment was a really positive learning experience as I got to start working on harder tasks I am not really used to doing. I struggled initially with how to even begin making the piece but after recieving some help by peers who had previously worked with technology like this I began to get the hang of things. I'm hoping by the end of the course I will be able to build much more complex and intricate pieces and look back at this as a starting point.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as an art instillation. With larger version's of this built viewer's could enter a room with these pressure sensors and depending on the pressure or the angle they are pushed at could change the rooms colour. This could even be applied with sound to make more of a complex project (Something I would like to look at in the future). We've seen many similar projects within the first two weeks so something like this isn't that out of the ordinary and could easily be completed with the knowledge. Another application could be for that of a game or other entertainment media for example, depending how hard you could push the sensor colours would flash to the player almost reminiscent of a punch machine found in arcades where the player is judged on how much pressure is applied with a punch with numerical point values. You could simply factor out the points and replace them with colours. Say Red being the best and Blue being the worst.
