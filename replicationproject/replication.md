Tomato Piano
http://www.seeedstudio.com/blog/2016/09/19/respeaker-tomato-piano-with-arduino/

![Image](tomato.jpg)

This project is very similar to the Banana keyboard as it uses tomatoes to replicate a piano. The project works by having a total of 8 tomatoes the 8 touch sensors on ReSpeaker. Each cherry tomato represents a key to the music note, starting from the ‘do’ to the ‘ti’. While this is very similar to the banana keyboard project it works on a larger scale and uses the arduino micro computer instead of the microbit. Having 8 tomatoes hooked up with each representing different tones also allows for the user to play mussic with the project too, something that could be considered for the replication. By having each piece of fruit represent a different tone the project could be made more complex rather than the simple original version and would allow for far more interaction. The project can be done with any object that conducts electricity too so you could use a variety of different fruits, or even other objects such as spoons, coins or conductive ink.

The world’s deepest bin

This installation was developed to get people putting more rubbish into bins and uses a basic sensor and speaker makeup. The idea is that when rubbish is put into the bin the sensor goes off playing audio through the speaker. The audio is of an object falling and eventually hitting the bottom of the bin, making it seem as though the piece of rubbish was falling deeper and deeper into the bin. This project is a fun idea and is doing some good. The premise is simple yet effective and some of the ideas could be applied to future projects.

Lenses

Lenses is an interactive insallation designed by the New York creative agency "Hush". The project is made up of various shaped objects that when bent, moved and changed  the colors and angles of the light trigger sound changes. This project uses light sensors and changes upon the colour of refracted light to create different sounds making each interaction different from the last. I found this project interesting because it shows what can be accomplished with a very simple idea, the agency have created a very interactive project with bare bones technology done well and I think this is something that can be learned from. I feel this piece also had a soft spot in my heart beacuse I enjoy intallations of this kind because they make an exhibition feel more intimate with each member of the crowd being able to have their own interaction with the project. Creating interactive pieces such as Lenses is something I could really see myself doing in the future.

Lines

Lines is an interactive sound instllation created by Swedish composer Anders Lind in 2016. Within the project lines are attached to the wall, on the floor and hanging from the ceiling in combination with sensors and electronics creating three musical instruments. Lines wanted to form a new way of exploring music through an interctive room. The project uses simple technology effectively creating a very interesting look into muscial exploration. On the surface the idea seems very simple but the work put in behind the scenes and the intricacies of the sounds matching with colours make it a very complex exhibition. Like many of the previous examples I have chosen to include Lines is extremely effective in creating an interactive fun expierence and I find this to be inspiring as an artist myself and makes me want to explore this avenue of design more and more.

Cousteau

Cousteau is a kinetic interactive sculpture. The project was a means of using simple movements to suggest that technology might possess its own life force. "Through a network of sensors, the sculpture monitors its surroundings, reacting to ambient activity, and a user’s proximity."(ArjoDesign 2019) The project itself is not really a sound installation nor does it reallt have anything to do with the banana keyboard however, I was drawn to the project. In a way I do see it as relating audio-wise because the servo-motors of the piece create this loud but soothing noise, almost like a large swarm of bugs which I found very interesting. I feel it added a whole new layer of life to the piece as opposed to if it were operating the same in complete silence. I find the idea of ambient noise being created on a large scale like within this project, other examples similar are machines making sounds similar to that of rain falling. I think it's just something about hearing such a natural sound coming from machines that is very strange.

TOTALLY AMAZING MUTANT EARS
https://www.arjodesign.com/#/ears/
![Image](ears.jpeg)
Totally Amazing Mutant Ears are sound-collecting headphones that turn every day sounds into completely new and unique aural experiences for the user. The sounds are made via mixing of four different digital distortion modes, these include: reverb, echo, metallic, pitch-shifting effect. The user no longer hears everyday sounds but is treated to hearing things out of this world as what they know is warped and changed. The idea of the project is to give the user the sense that they were dealing with martians or were on another planet or underwater. The piece is made of headphones, a digital sound processor and microphone all combined with added plastic parts to keep it all together. Such a fun idea could be marketed as a childrens toy or created on a large scale of an exhibition installation.

## Reading reflections ##
*Reflective reading is an important part of actually making your reading worthwhile. Don't just read the words to understand what they say: read to see how the ideas in the text fit with and potentially change your existing knowledge and maybe even conceptual frameworks. We assume you can basically figure out what the readings mean, but the more important process is to understand how that changes what you think, particularly in the context of your project.*

*For each of the assigned readings, answer the questions below.*

### Reading: Don Norman, The Design of Everyday Things, Chapter 1 (The Psychopathology of Everyday Things) ###

*What I thought before: Before the reading I had no real prior knowledge to the subjects explained, I had heard briefly pieces about affordance in deisgn theory courses but had never truly gone into much detail about the theory. To my understanding affordance is the relationship between the user and an object with the affordances being what dynamic can play out between the two. The idea of affordance has always confused me a little beacuse the term can be so loosely used to describe objects, which I'm sure in some cases is being used wrong but people would be non the wiser about this. The term itself is often misunderstood I think leading to a lot of confusion around what the concept really is and I'm hoping that within the reading this can be cleared but for me and a concrete definition can be given. I would like to have a better understanding of design concepts, because I think that every great designer should adhear to these rules and ensure they are pushing forward the best possible product.*

*What I learned: From this reading I finally have gained more of an understanding of the concept "Affordance" as well as the other important aspects of designing interaction. The reading goes into depth about the five fundamental psychological concepts in relation to interaction. These concepts inculded: affordances, signifiers, constraints, mappings,
and feedback. As I have aldready said I have had some prior expereince with the term affordances but this reading allowed me to further understand the term and its role in the design world. The example used about a chair and the affordances it had with a person helped me greatly in understanding jsut what this relationship was. The idea that every physical object can have affordances or this relationship with the user whether they be a person, animal, or machine is actually really interesting and I can see how this can shape the way an object is designed.*

Signifiers were also explained, from my understanding these are the everyday marks or sounds that tell us exactly what to do with an object such as a push and pull sign on a door. Signifiers show us the correct behaviours to abide by in regards to something and similarly to affordance represent a relationship between an object and the user. Whatever their nature, planned or accidental, signifiers provide valuable clues as to the nature of the world and of social activities. Without them we wouldn't know what to do half of the time. Going back to the door as an example think about how many times you have pushed a pull door or vice versa, this is a prime example of why signifiers are needed. From what this reading has taught me when designing signifiers are a must.*

*Mapping is simply the relationship between the elements of two sets of things. the example used in the reading put it very well, you see a large number of lights in an auditorium and a row of switches on the wall at the front of the room. The mapping between switches to lights specifies which switch controls which light. This reading taught me that mapping is one of the most important aspets of a design's display using uses spatial correspondence between the layout of the controls and the objects which are being controlled*

*Feedback was the most simple concept to understand in the reading beacuse it is feedback, it does exactly what you would imagine. The feedback is the communicating the results of an action. However, what I actually learned through the reading about feedback is that it must be absolutely immediate a delay of a tenth of a second can be disconcerting to a user. If the delay is too long, people might often give up, going off to do other activities. It is the combination of all these elements that leads to a good design and this reading has taught me that there is no way an interaction can work without all of the above, there will just be a large variety of underlying issues without.*

*What I would like to know more about: I would like to learn more about how these concepts are introduced into the design process, how the designer goes from having a conceptual idea to the final product, ensuring that they are including all these important ideas. I feel that as a designer it is almost my duty to get as in depth knowledge of these theories as possible to ensure that I can produce the best possible work in future.*

*How this relates to the project I am working on: This reading relates to the current project as I now know more of a technical side to the project I will be re-creating. For example, I can tell you what the affordances are for the banana keyboard or what the products feedback is. This new knowledge will make explaining the experiment so much easier because I now have a more in depth understanding of exaclty what it is I am working on. While these readings may be a bit straining to read sometimes, and will often require a second or third reading and thought proccess they do really help get a better understanding of concepts.*

### Reading: Chapter 1 of Dan Saffer, Microinteractions: Designing with Details, Chapter 1 ###

*What I thought before: Prior to reading this piece I had never encountered the term "microinteraction" being more of a artist, rather than designer at this point I don't really have much knowledge of this sort of termonology. In saying this though, I am keen to hear about what this entails. I am imagining that microinteractions like the name would lead on are small interactions within a product or design that exist solely to perform one small purpose? This would appear to be the most obvious observation or guess on my part however, I could be very wrong. *

*What I learned: What I learned from this reading is exactly what I had guessed microinteractions to be. Microinteractions are acontained product moment that revolves around a single use case. They are a tiny piece of functionality that only does one thing for the product, micro interactions could power the device as a whole or exist along other software that allow them to function. The best way to explain a microinteraction is that they exist to make the device feel engaging and welcoming not confusing the user. They almost exist to make the device more human and ensure we have the easiest time possible using it. The reading uses the iPhone's silence button as a very good example of a microinteraction and how it works. The silence button on your phone does not silence the sounds that users have specifically asked for, only those they have not such as text messages, incoming phone calls. This a great example of a microinteraction, there is a reason the function is designed to be this way. Think about if the phone completely silenced everything when the mode was on. You would be sleeping, through alarms constantly and the phone would become a glorified paper weight with the silence mode on because you wouldn't hear a single beep from it. Microinteractions exist to give us feedback, the good bad and everything between. They exist to make the users life easier. However, these interactions must address 3 fundamental things: What might happen if an action will be taken, What is happening and finally what happened or showing the confirmation or a result of a user’s action.  *

*What I would like to know more about: I would like to learn more about what makes these functions work, for example the silence button. I would be interested to see how much work and coding goes into doing such a simple yet complex task. The idea of microinteractions is something I had never considered but have now started noticing with everything I use on a day to day basis.*

*How this relates to the project I am working on: This reading could apply to the project I am working on at the moment as I could now consider the microinteractions in regard to the banana keybaord. An idea of this could be adding an LED to each piece of fruit that would light up when the circuit is complete and the sound is made, in doing this the project gains another way of showing that the task has been complete by not just playing the noise but having an accompanying light. By setting this up those with poor hearing or deaf could still know that the task is being completed because the light is displaying on touch. It is the small interations such as this that make the difference between a good and bad design. These interactions can be the difference between a good and bad design*

### Reading: Scott Sullivan, Prototyping Interactive Objects ###

*What I thought before: Prior to reading the piece I was starting to get a grasp on these basic concepts, slowly but surely I was beginning to understand more and more to do with making interactive media, and what exactly this would do. This reading shows exactly what is possible with this knowledge and how the use of basic code knowledge combined with arduino can produce useful technology such as the example used within the text that captures anonymous movement data from patrons visiting a small
retail store in order to rework the store for the best possible outcome.  *

*What I learned: This reading taught me that the things we are currently learning can have very interesting real world integration, the example the reading uses really interested me because it serves a very neccessary need. The basic idea behind the project was to design a product with arduino that could track patrons movements and allow the owners of the store to see where people would be moving to and looking most. This would allow them to change where products are placed and the stores general layout to allow for the best amount of sales. This idea works very well and it's amazing that a product can be developed and coded with arduino micro-computers to do so. It is things like this that really caputre my interest because they have a real world application, a lot of the expereiments and other smaller works done in the microbit booklet have very little application. I hope to begin moving towards working on projects like this and starting to develop more of an understanding of the micro-computer and how I can begin creating more complex projects with the technology.*

*What I would like to know more about: I would like to learn more about how to begin coding harder concepts like this as well as using more complex pieces on the BBC Microbit. Now that I am starting to get a better understanding of these concepts I am beginning to feel more comfortable moving onto tasks like this.*

*How this relates to the project I am working on: This reading is direclty linked to this replication task as we are building on the microbit much like the reading explains building with arduino. Both micro-computers are very similar meaning that similar projects can be built on both very easily. There are a variety of videos online of people completing the banana keyboard with arduino or makey makey micro-computers meaning that once you have the knowledge of how to use one you can apply this knowledge to other products.*
